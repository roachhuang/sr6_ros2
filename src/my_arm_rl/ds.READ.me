Step 6: Deploy to Real Robot

    Replace Gazebo Topics with Real Robot:
    Modify gazebo_env.py to use your robot's joint state topic (e.g., /actual_joint_states) and command topic (e.g., /joint_velocity_commands).

    Subscribes to /joint_states (or sensors)
    Use Trained Model:
    Load the saved model in a ROS 2 node:
    Uses the trained model to compute actions
    Publishes to /arm_controller/command or similar

class RealArmNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('real_arm_node')
        self.model = torch.load('path/to/trained_model.pt')
        self.model.eval()
        # ROS 2 publishers/subscribers for real hardware

    def joint_state_callback(self, msg):
        state = self.extract_obs(msg)
        action = self.model(torch.tensor(state)).detach().numpy()
        self.publish_action(action)

Key Improvements for Production

    Use a Proper RL Library:
    Implement Stable-Baselines3 for advanced algorithms (PPO, SAC).

    Action Space:
    Switch to continuous control (e.g., SAC/TD3) for smoother motions.

    Sim-to-Real Transfer:

        Add domain randomization in Gazebo (friction, masses, noise).

        Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for better physics.

    ROS 2 Services:
    Create services for resetting the environment and triggering inference.
