The offset=-π/2 for joint 2 exists because:

Physical robot construction - Your robot's joint 2 motor is physically mounted such that when the motor reads 0°, the link is not in the DH convention's "zero" position

DH convention alignment - Standard DH convention defines joint angles relative to specific geometric relationships between consecutive coordinate frames

Looking at your code:

RevoluteDH(d=0, a=a2, alpha=0, offset=-np.pi / 2),  # joint 2

Copy
Why specifically -π/2 (90°)?

Motor mounting angle - Joint 2's motor/encoder is mounted 90° rotated from where DH convention expects it

Kinematic consistency - Without this offset, your forward kinematics would be wrong by 90°

Zero position alignment - When motor reads 0°, the actual geometric angle (per DH) is -90°
